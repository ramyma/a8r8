* Runs in browser

* Full [Controlnet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet) support

* Open canvas with unified interface

* VRam usage info

* Scaling and hires like built in solution

* Integration with [TiledVAE](https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111), [Tiled Diffusion](https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111) and [Self Attention Guidance](https://github.com/ashen-sensored/sd_webui_SAG)

* Sketch, mask and Controlnet layers

* Image info support (on import only for now)

[A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) has deservedly held it's place as the go to SD tool, it's awesome and everyday there're amazing new integrations and extensions, however, the interface leaves somethings to be desired.

A8R8 has been in the making for the past few months, and I tried to make it as intuitive as possible. It's not meant to be a full image editor nor a beginner's tool; it's more of an opinionated power tool.

A lot more to come, this is just starting!
